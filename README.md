# ABC - Arduino Binary Calculator

This is a small software designed to do calculations within python and then sending the data in binary format to an arduino. The Arduino then lights up LEDs according to the binary number.

## Prerequisites
You need to have python installed. I used [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).
###

In ```src/main.py``` you should change the **'port'** as well as the **'baudrate'** to which ever you need.

To run the program run ```python.exe main.py```
